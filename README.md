this was a fairly in depth project. consists of a 5 stage tab bar that includes:
-date picker: picker that allows you to select month and day, and upon choosing select button also tells you exact time.
-single picker: a single picker that creatively allows you to select between star wars characters, also with a submit button.
-double picker: allows you to pick between sandwich types and breads you might want your sandwich on, with a select button.
-dependent picker: allows you to pick between states in the US, and displays their appropriate zip codes(dependent, 2nd picker column is zip and changes depending on the first column, which is state), and functioning sumbit button.
-custom picker: a game of slots! has 5 slots and a spin button that controls them. does not allow user to change the picker, includes sounds of spinning and an exciting win noise, and a label stating "WINNER!" upon winning that stays hidden otherwise. 
enjoy!
